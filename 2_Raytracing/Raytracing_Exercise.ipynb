But for large arrays this does not hold anymore. A very rough rule of thumb is that you should consider using a normal `Array` for arrays larger than 100 elements. Whenever it is possible use `StaticArrays` for small arrays in the exercises to speed up your algorithms.\n",

You can start with a function `lambertLighting(scene::AbstractScene,lights::Lights,normal::SVector{3,Float32})`, which applies a specific `lambertLighting` function to each light contained in `lights`. Both light sources have to be treated differently. Ambient light should always contribute to a pixel's lighting with a fixed `intensity`. In contrast, the sun light illuminates surfaces dependent on the surface normal $\\mathbf n$. Let $\\mathbf l$ be the unit vector pointing towards the sun, then the sun's `intensity` has to be scaled by $\\text{min}(\\mathbf l \\cdot \\mathbf n,0)$. This is refered to as Lambert lighting. Keep in mind, that a pixel's lighting can be influenced by both light sources.\n",

    "## 4.4 Shiny Objects and Reflections\n",
    "Up to now we rendered perfectly diffuse surfaces using the Lambert shader. This lighting model very well reproduces the appearance of rough surfaces (clay). However, many surfaces have some degree of shininess (polished marble, brushed metal), which leads to bright spots (highlights). Observe that in nature these highlights are centered around the point on the surface, which would reflect the light of the light source directly to the observer. Around this center the intensity usually falls off very quickly (slower for rougher surfaces). This behavior can be captured by using the Blin-Phong lighting model, which replaces $\\text{min}(\\mathbf l \\cdot \\mathbf n,0)$ by $\\text{min}(\\mathbf h \\cdot \\mathbf n,0)^p$, $p > 0$. The larger $p$ the more shiny the surface will apear. $\\mathbf h$ denotes the half vector between the viewing and light-source direction. Here, use $p=8$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, shiny surfaces will reflect some part of the light. This creates reflections of the surounding objects. Such reflections can be created by shooting yet another ray into the direction of reflection and recursively following its path, while accumulating light each time an object is hit. The reflection direction can be obtained from the direction of the incomming ray $\\mathbf d$ and the normal vector of the surface by $\\mathbf d - 2(\\mathbf d \\cdot \\mathbf n)\\mathbf n$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Adapt your lighting functions by using the Blin-Phong lighting model and partial reflections. When shading, calculate the Blin-Phong contribution first and start following the ray of reflection later. Half of the light from the reflection hit point should be added to the shading of the primary hit point. If necessary also secondary contributions should be taken into account. I.e. when the primary reflection ray hits an object, a secondary should be casted and treated just as the primary, such that the light at the secondary reflection hit point then contributes with $0.5^2$ to the light of the primary hit point.\n",
