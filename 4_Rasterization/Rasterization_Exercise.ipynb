    "### 1. Rendering a Sphere\n",
    "While the last exercise primarily dealt with simple 2-dimensional objects, we are now going to render more complex 3-dimensional objects. In order to render such objects we need a way to load the vertices and the indices making up each face from files.\n",
    "For this purpose consider the following code, which extracts the given information from obj-files.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this code at hand, load the sphere contained in the file `sphere.obj` and render it. This involves the following steps:\n",
    "* store the vertices in a VBO and create an EBO for the indices making up the faces. \n",
    "* link the VBO to the current VAO.\n",
    "* implement simple shaders such that each fragment is renderd in a fixed color that you like\n",
    "\n",
    "For illustration also draw the wireframe of the primitives. This can be achieved by setting the plotting mode to wireframe mode, using `glPolygonMode(GL_FRONT_AND_BACK, GL_LINE)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*Remarks:*\n",
    "* For this exercise, you need to add the packages `FileIO`, `ImageMagick`, and `ImageIO`.\n",
    "* The file `utils.jl` contains the functions `initWindow`, `key_callback` and `compileShaderProgram`, which were implemented in the last exercise."

    "Next, we are going to add an asteroid field to our scene. The latter will be formed by rendering the same rock object at different positions around the planet. \n",
    "\n",
    "The direct way to approach this is to have to have multiple calls to `glDrawElements` - namely one for each rock. Prior to each rendering call, a new shift-vector is specified via a uniform. This approach is not optimal, because each rendering call requires a significant amount of data-movement over the CPU-to-GPU bus. Thus, performance is not limited by the actual rendering of the vertices but rather by the data-transfer associated with each draw-command.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instancing is a way to draw multiple instances of an object using a single-rendering call. This implies that all the data needed for the rendering needs to be passed to the GPU only once.\n",
    "\n",
    "To render our planet with the asteroid field using instancing, we start by generating a new window. Then we load vertices and indices of the rock object. Additionally, we compute its normal vectors and we generate a randomized array of shifts to position the rocks around the planet."
